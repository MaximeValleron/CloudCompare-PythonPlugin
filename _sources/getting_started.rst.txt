Getting Started
===============


This plugin allows to write Python scripts to automate some tasks in CloudCompare

.. caution::
    This plugin is in its very early stage, so a lot of things are missings
    some things may not work, bugs are most probably common, etc


This plugin allows to run scripts in the 2 _CloudCompares_ 'modes': GUI & CommandLine.

GUI
---

In GUI, there are 3 actions:

*  The REPL (Read Print Eval Loop) which allows for quick testing of some actions.
    .. image:: ../images/repl-icon.png

*  The editor which allows to create,edit,save python script and most importantly run them.
    .. image:: ../images/python-editor-icon.png

*  The file runner, which shows a small dialog where you can select a file and run it 
   whithout having to have the editor openned.

The typical python script will need to import Python modules that provide access to
functions and data-structures of cloudcompare:

.. code:: Python

    # cccorelib contains definitions of tools, such as Cloud2Cloud distance,
    # sampling algorithm, etc
    import cccorelib

    # pycc contains definitions of data structures and other things,
    # the most important being getting the current running CC instance
    # to retreive point cloud/meshes
    import pycc

    # The CC object is the interface that will allow you to navigate
    # the tree of files currently loaded, the list of files selected, etc
    CC = pycc.GetInstance()


CC will be an object of type :class:`pycc.ccPythonInstance`.


Command Line
------------

Similarly a commandline script will start with the following lines:

.. code:: Python

    import cccorelib
    import pycc

    CC = pycc.GetCmdLineInstance()

CC will be an object of type :class:`pycc.ccCommandLineInterface`.


To run in command line mode pass following option: `-PYTHON_SCRIPT`

.. code:: shell

    cloudcompare -PYTHON_SCRIPT my_script.py


The plugin will take all arguments that follows the script name and populate
python's sys.argv with them:

Example:

.. code:: shell

    /path/to/cloudcompare -PYTHON_SCRIPT my_script.py some_positional_arg --size 50

Python's sys.argv will be equal to:
['/path/to/cloudcompare', 'some_positional_arg', '--size', '50']
