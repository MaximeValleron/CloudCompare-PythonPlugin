Building from sources
=====================


Building as Plugin
------------------

In the following sections we assume that you know
how to compile CloudCompare from source, otherwise refer
to the CloudCompare documentation on how to do.


To Compile this plugin you need to have Python installed.


Windows
_______

1. Clone this project into CloudCompare/plugins/private
2. Create a virtual environment via ``venv`` or ``conda``
   
   .. code-block::
        
       # Python's venv
       python -m venv .\pyccvenv 

       # Conda environment
       conda create -n pyccenv 

3. Activate the environment

   .. code-block::

       # Python's venv (PowerShell)
       .\pyccenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

       # Conda environment
       conda activate pyccenv

4. install dependencies
    
   .. code-block::

       pip install -r requirements-release.txt

5. Generate the cmake config

    To generate the cmake config you have 2 options:

    1. Start the cmake generation while still within the activated environment
    
    2. Add ``-DPTYHON_EXECUTABLE="somepath_to_python.exe"``
       Where ``somepath_to_python.exe`` is the absolute path to the python executable 
       of the pyccenv created earlier. 

       To get it, run: ``python -c "import sys;print(sys.executable)"`` (while in the activated env)

    In both cases the cmake option to add in order to build the plugin in ``-DPLUGIN_PYTHON=ON``


6. Build
7. Install
   

Linux
_____


1. Clone this project in CloudCompare/plugins/private
2. Install additional dependencies

    Ubuntu: ``libpython3-dev`` and ``pybind11-dev`` (only available since 20.04)

    Fedora: ``python3-devel`` and  ``pybind11-devel``


3. Run cmake with ``-DPLUGIN_PYTHON=ON``
4. Build
5. Install



Building as indenpendent wheels
-------------------------------

It is also possible to build and install the bindings as standard python
packages to use them in python scripts (run by a standalone python executable
and not the embedded python in the plugin). 

To do so:

.. code-block:: console

    # Building the wheels

    pip wheel --no-deps wrapper/cccorelib
    pip wheel --no-deps wrapper/pycc

    # Installing directly

    pip install wrapper/cccorelib
    pip install wrapper/pycc



Other development related things
--------------------------------


Running the tests
_________________

Tests works by running CloudCompare in command line mode.
To run them, you need pytest, and you need to provide to pytest the path the where CloudCompare is installed

.. code-block::
    
    # in CloudCompare/plugins/private/CloudCompare-PythonPlugin:

    pytest --cloudcompare_exe "C:\CMakeBuilds\CloudCompare\Release\install\CloudCompare\CloudCompare.exe" tests

Building the documentation
__________________________

Building the documentation also works by running CloudCompare in command line mode.
To build the documentation:

.. code-block::

    cd docs
    .\make-docs.ps1 "C:\CMakeBuilds\CloudCompare\Release\install\CloudCompare\CloudCompare.exe"

Which by default will build the docs in HTML in docs/_build. Open docs/_build/index.html to view it.
(The output dir can be changed using the `-OutputDir` option)
